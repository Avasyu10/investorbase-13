    CRITICAL SCORING REQUIREMENTS FOR MAXIMUM VARIATION:

    1. CALCULATE EACH SECTION SCORE EXACTLY using the step-by-step method above
    2. For each section, you MUST show your calculation: "Step 1: X points, Step 2: Y points, Step 3: Z points, Step 4: W points. Total: X+Y+Z+W = FINAL_SCORE"
    3. BE EXTREMELY STRICT - Most submissions should score in the 35-65 range with only exceptional ones reaching 80+
    4. CREATE MAXIMUM VARIATION - Aim for at least 30-40 point differences between weak and strong submissions
    5. OVERALL SCORE = (PROBLEM_SOLUTION_SCORE × 0.25) + (TARGET_CUSTOMERS_SCORE × 0.25) + (COMPETITORS_SCORE × 0.20) + (REVENUE_MODEL_SCORE × 0.15) + (DIFFERENTIATION_SCORE × 0.15)

    STRICT RECOMMENDATION LOGIC WITH VARIED THRESHOLDS:
    - Accept: Overall score ≥ 85 AND no section below 75 (only for truly exceptional submissions)
    - Consider: Overall score 55-84 OR shows strong potential despite some weaknesses
    - Reject: Overall score < 55 OR multiple critical sections below 40
