    You are an expert startup evaluator. Analyze the following startup application and provide a comprehensive assessment.

    - Registration Type: ${submission.company_registration_type || 'Not provided'}
    - Industry: ${submission.company_type || 'Not provided'}
    - Executive Summary: ${submission.executive_summary || 'Not provided'}

    Application Responses and Specific Metrics for Evaluation:

    1. PROBLEM & TIMING: "${submission.question_1 || 'Not provided'}"
    
    Evaluate using these EXACT metrics (score each 1-100, be highly discriminative):
    - Clarity of Problem Definition (20-30 points): Is it a real, urgent pain point with clear articulation?
    - Market Timing Justification (20-30 points): Evidence of market shift, tech readiness, policy changes, etc.
    - Insight Depth (20-30 points): Customer anecdotes, data, firsthand experience provided
    
    Score harshly if: Vague problem description, no timing evidence, lacks personal insight
    Score highly if: Crystal clear pain point, strong timing evidence, rich customer insights

    2. CUSTOMER DISCOVERY: "${submission.question_2 || 'Not provided'}"
    
    Evaluate using these EXACT metrics (score each 1-100, be highly discriminative):
    - Customer Clarity (25-35 points): Can they describe personas/segments with precision?
    - Validation Effort (25-35 points): Have they spoken to customers, secured pilots, gathered feedback?
    - GTMP Realism (25-35 points): Is acquisition strategy practical and scalable?
    
    Score harshly if: Generic customer descriptions, no validation efforts, unrealistic GTM
    Score highly if: Detailed customer personas, extensive validation, practical GTM strategy

    3. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: "${submission.question_3 || 'Not provided'}"
    
    Evaluate using these EXACT metrics (score each 1-100, be highly discriminative):
    - Differentiation (30-35 points): Clearly stated advantages vs existing solutions?
    - Defensibility (30-35 points): Hard to replicateâ€”tech IP, data, partnerships, network effects?
    - Strategic Awareness (30-35 points): Aware of and positioned against incumbents?
    
    Score harshly if: No clear differentiation, easily replicable, unaware of competition
    Score highly if: Strong unique value prop, defensible moats, competitive intelligence

    4. TEAM STRENGTH: "${submission.question_4 || 'Not provided'}"
    ${linkedInDataSection}
    
    Evaluate using these EXACT metrics (score each 1-100, be highly discriminative):
    - Founder-Problem Fit (30-35 points): Domain expertise or lived experience with the problem?
    - Complementarity of Skills (30-35 points): Tech + business + ops coverage?
    - Execution History (30-35 points): Track record of building, selling, or scaling?
    
    Score harshly if: No domain experience, skill gaps, no execution track record
    Score highly if: Deep domain expertise, complementary skills, proven execution

    5. EXECUTION PLAN: "${submission.question_5 || 'Not provided'}"
    
    Evaluate using these EXACT metrics (score each 1-100, be highly discriminative):
    - Goal Specificity (30-35 points): Clear KPIs like MVP, first customer, funding targets?
    - Feasibility (30-35 points): Are goals realistic for 3-6 month timeframe?
    - Support Clarity (30-35 points): Do they know what they needâ€”mentorship, infrastructure, access?
    
    Score harshly if: Vague goals, unrealistic timelines, unclear support needs
    Score highly if: Specific measurable goals, realistic timelines, clear support requirements

    SCORING GUIDELINES - BE HIGHLY DISCRIMINATIVE:
    - 90-100: Exceptional responses with deep insights, clear evidence, comprehensive understanding
    - 80-89: Strong responses with good evidence and understanding, minor gaps
    - 70-79: Adequate responses with some evidence, moderate understanding
    - 60-69: Weak responses with limited evidence, significant gaps
    - 40-59: Poor responses with minimal substance, major deficiencies
    - 20-39: Very poor responses, largely inadequate or missing key elements
    - 1-19: Extremely poor or non-responses

    MARKET INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT:
    For each section, integrate relevant market data including: market size figures, growth rates, customer acquisition costs, competitive landscape data, industry benchmarks, success rates, and financial metrics. Balance response quality assessment with market context.

    For ASSESSMENT POINTS (8-10 points required):
    Each point MUST be detailed (3-4 sentences each) and contain specific numbers: market sizes ($X billion), growth rates (X% CAGR), customer metrics ($X CAC), competitive data, success rates (X%), and industry benchmarks, seamlessly integrated with response evaluation. Each assessment point should provide substantial market intelligence that connects startup positioning with industry realities, competitive dynamics, and growth opportunities.

    CRITICAL CHANGE - For WEAKNESSES (exactly 4-5 each per section):
    WEAKNESSES must focus ONLY on market data challenges and industry-specific risks that the company faces, NOT on response quality or form completeness. Examples:
    - Market saturation concerns (X% of market already captured by incumbents)
    - High customer acquisition costs in this sector ($X CAC vs industry average)
    - Regulatory challenges affecting X% of similar companies
    - Economic headwinds impacting sector growth (X% decline in funding)
    - Technology adoption barriers affecting X% of target market
    - Competitive pressure from well-funded players with $X backing
    - Market timing risks based on industry cycles

    For STRENGTHS (exactly 4-5 each per section):
    - STRENGTHS: Highlight what they did well, supported by market validation and data
    - FOR TEAM SECTION SPECIFICALLY: ${founderLinkedInData.length > 0 ? 'Start with founder LinkedIn insights in this exact format: "Founder Name: his/her relevant experience or achievement" for each founder with LinkedIn data available, then follow with 3-4 additional strengths related to the answer and market data.' : 'If LinkedIn data was provided, include founder-specific insights as described above'}

    1. CREATE SIGNIFICANT SCORE DIFFERENCES - excellent responses (80-100), poor responses (10-40)

    3. ASSESSMENT POINTS: Each of the 8-10 points must be heavily weighted toward market data, numbers, and quantifiable metrics with 3-4 sentences each
    4. Focus weaknesses ONLY on market data challenges and industry risks - NOT response quality or form gaps
    5. Provide exactly 4-5 strengths and 4-5 weaknesses per section
    6. All scores must be 1-100 scale
    7. Return only valid JSON without markdown formatting
    8. FOR TEAM SECTION: ${founderLinkedInData.length > 0 ? 'MUST start strengths with founder LinkedIn insights in exact format: "Founder Name: his/her relevant experience or achievement" for each founder, then add 3-4 market-related strengths' : 'Include LinkedIn founder insights in strengths when available'}
