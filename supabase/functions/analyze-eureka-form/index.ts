    CRITICAL SCORING GUIDELINES - BE EXTREMELY DISCRIMINATIVE BASED ON ANSWER QUALITY:
    - 90-100: Exceptional responses with deep insights, clear evidence, comprehensive understanding, DETAILED RESPONSES (150+ words with specific examples, data, and thorough explanations)
    - 80-89: Strong responses with good evidence and understanding, minor gaps, GOOD DETAIL (100-150 words with some specifics)
    - 70-79: Adequate responses with some evidence, moderate understanding, MODERATE DETAIL (50-100 words)
    - 60-69: Weak responses with limited evidence, significant gaps, BRIEF RESPONSES (20-50 words)
    - 40-59: Poor responses with minimal substance, major deficiencies, VERY SHORT (10-20 words)
    - 20-39: Very poor responses, largely inadequate or missing key elements, EXTREMELY SHORT (5-10 words)
    - 1-19: Extremely poor or non-responses, ONE-WORD ANSWERS OR MEANINGLESS TEXT (under 5 words)

    ANSWER LENGTH AND DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
    - Answers under 10 words should NEVER score above 30
    - Answers under 50 words should rarely score above 60
    - Answers over 100 words with specific details should score 70+
    - Answers over 200 words with comprehensive analysis should score 80+
    - Only award 90+ for truly exceptional, detailed responses with evidence and insights

    MARKET INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT:
    For each section, integrate relevant market data including: market size figures, growth rates, customer acquisition costs, competitive landscape data, industry benchmarks, success rates, and financial metrics. Balance response quality assessment with market context.

    For ASSESSMENT POINTS (8-10 points required):
    Each point MUST be detailed (3-4 sentences each) and contain specific numbers: market sizes ($X billion), growth rates (X% CAGR), customer metrics ($X CAC), competitive data, success rates (X%), and industry benchmarks, seamlessly integrated with response evaluation. Each assessment point should provide substantial market intelligence that connects startup positioning with industry realities, competitive dynamics, and growth opportunities.

    CRITICAL CHANGE - For WEAKNESSES (exactly 4-5 each per section):
    WEAKNESSES must focus ONLY on market data challenges and industry-specific risks that the company faces, NOT on response quality or form completeness. Examples:
    - Market saturation concerns (X% of market already captured by incumbents)
    - High customer acquisition costs in this sector ($X CAC vs industry average)
    - Regulatory challenges affecting X% of similar companies
    - Economic headwinds impacting sector growth (X% decline in funding)
    - Technology adoption barriers affecting X% of target market
    - Competitive pressure from well-funded players with $X backing
    - Market timing risks based on industry cycles

    For STRENGTHS (exactly 4-5 each per section):
    - STRENGTHS: Highlight what they did well, supported by market validation and data

    5. ASSESSMENT POINTS: Each of the 8-10 points must be heavily weighted toward market data, numbers, and quantifiable metrics with 3-4 sentences each
    6. Focus weaknesses ONLY on market data challenges and industry risks - NOT response quality or form gaps
    7. Provide exactly 4-5 strengths and 4-5 weaknesses per section
    8. All scores must be 1-100 scale
    9. Return only valid JSON without markdown formatting
