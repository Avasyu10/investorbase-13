**Important**: IN SECTIONS, in the description of each section make sure to give 4-5 detailed points including market data and numbers and also don't mention words pitch deck or deck as it is about the company and deck is just for extracting info about company.

COMPANY INFORMATION EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Stage: Look for funding stage mentions (seed, pre-seed, series A/B/C, growth, bootstrap, etc.)
- Industry: Identify the business sector/domain (fintech, healthcare, edtech, saas, marketplace, etc.)
- Website: Extract any website URLs mentioned in the deck
- Description: Create a brief company description based on the pitch content

SECTION CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS:
- For each section, provide only a brief description of what content was found (if any)
- Focus on identifying whether each section is present and what key information it contains
- Do not provide scores, ratings, strengths, weaknesses, or detailed assessments
- Keep descriptions concise and factual

SLIDE-BY-SLIDE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST provide exactly 4 detailed notes for EACH slide in the deck
- Each note should be 2-3 sentences long with specific observations
- Include content analysis, design feedback, business insights, and recommendations
- Reference specific elements visible on each slide (text, charts, images, etc.)
- Provide both positive observations and constructive criticism
- Include market context and industry benchmarks where relevant

IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide EXACTLY 15 actionable improvement suggestions.
- Each suggestion must be specific and implementable, clearly stating the 'WHY' (importance) and 'HOW' (implementation guidance).
- MUST include at least 5 UI/Design-specific suggestions. Examples:
    * "Improve slide layout consistency and visual hierarchy by using uniform header styles, consistent font sizing, and deliberate spacing between content elements (e.g., increased line height, margin-bottom on paragraphs) to enhance readability and professional appearance."
    * "Enhance chart and graph readability by ensuring clear labels, proper legends, distinct data point markers, and a consistent, high-contrast color scheme throughout all visualizations, enabling rapid data interpretation for investors."
    * "Reduce visual clutter and improve scannability by strategically increasing white space around text blocks and images, refining text alignment (e.g., left-aligned body text), and transforming dense paragraphs into concise, impactful bullet points where appropriate."
    * "Standardize typography across the entire presentation by selecting a maximum of two complementary fonts, applying consistent font sizes for headings and body text, and maintaining a unified color palette to reinforce brand identity and visual coherence."
    * "Optimize image and graphic quality by ensuring all visual assets are high-resolution, relevant to the content, and professionally integrated (e.g., proper cropping, consistent styling), avoiding pixelation or generic stock photos that detract from credibility."
    * "Incorporate compelling product visuals, such as high-fidelity screenshots, intuitive mockups, or brief animated GIFs (if web-based), to visually demonstrate the solution's functionality and user experience more effectively than text descriptions alone."
    * "Ensure a clean, uncluttered overall design aesthetic by minimizing excessive borders, unnecessary icons, or overly complex backgrounds, allowing the core content to stand out."
- Content improvement suggestions should cover key business areas. Examples:
    * **(Conditional: ONLY if Market Sizing is absent or lacks depth)** "Add a dedicated Market Sizing slide that clearly outlines the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM, or target market share), backed by recent data from credible industry reports, to provide investors with a precise understanding of the market scale and the company's growth potential."
    * **(Conditional: ONLY if Competitive Analysis is absent or superficial)** "Include a comprehensive competitive analysis slide, ideally structured as a matrix or quadrant, that identifies both direct and indirect competitors, highlights key differentiators (e.g., features, pricing, unique technology), and clearly articulates the company's sustainable competitive advantages to demonstrate market awareness and strategic positioning."
    * **(Conditional: ONLY if Traction/Social Proof is absent or weak)** "Integrate stronger evidence of traction by including customer testimonials, verifiable case studies showcasing user success and impact, or key logos of partners/clients, as these provide crucial social proof and validate market acceptance."
    * **(Conditional: ONLY if Financials are absent or highly ambiguous)** "Develop a clear and defensible financial overview, including high-level revenue projections (e.g., 3-5 years), key unit economics (e.g., LTV, CAC), burn rate, runway, and a plausible path to profitability, which are essential for investors to assess financial viability and return potential."
    * **(Conditional: ONLY if Team Background is missing, too brief, or irrelevant to product/industry)** "Strengthen the 'Team' section by providing concise yet impactful profiles for each key team member, emphasizing their relevant industry experience, previous successes, specific roles, and how their unique skills (e.g., technical, sales, operational) directly contribute to the company's ability to execute its vision. Also, highlight any notable advisors or board members."
    * **(Conditional: ONLY if Product Roadmap is absent or vague)** "Present a forward-looking product roadmap that outlines key development milestones (e.g., MVP launch, next major features), future technological integrations, and strategic priorities for the next 12-24 months, allowing investors to understand the product's evolution and future growth drivers."
    * **(Conditional: ALWAYS include)** "Clearly define 'The Ask' (specific funding amount) and provide a detailed allocation breakdown of how the capital will be utilized (e.g., % for product development, % for marketing, % for team expansion), linking fund usage directly to achieving specific, measurable milestones."
    * **(Conditional: ALWAYS include)** "Refine the overall narrative flow of the presentation to tell a compelling and logical story, ensuring a seamless transition from problem to solution, market opportunity, business model, and financial projections, as a cohesive narrative significantly enhances investor understanding and recall."
    * **(Conditional: Consider if deck has too much text)** "Condense verbose slides into concise, impactful statements and use clear headings with supporting bullet points to convey information efficiently, respecting investor time and improving memorability."
