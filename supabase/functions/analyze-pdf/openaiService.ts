    const prompt = `Analyze this pitch deck PDF image and provide a detailed evaluation with the following elements:

1. An overall assessment with a score between 1-5 (1 decimal place precision) where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent
2. 4-6 key assessment points that include specific numbers, market data, and quantitative insights
3. Create detailed sections analyzing different aspects with these requirements:
   - Each section must have a descriptive title
   - Each section must include a score between 1-5 (1 decimal place precision)
   - Each section must have a thorough description with specific numbers and quantitative data
   - For each section, list 3-5 strengths with numerical support (e.g., "Strong market growth potential with 22% CAGR")
   - For each section, list 3-5 weaknesses with numerical support (e.g., "Revenue projection of $2M in Year 1 seems optimistic given average industry performance of $500K")

Sections MUST include:
1. Market Research (market size, growth rate, TAM/SAM/SOM figures, competitive landscape with market share data)
2. Business Model (pricing structure with specific tiers/numbers, revenue projections, unit economics, margins)
3. Team Assessment (team size, experience metrics, key role coverage percentage, leadership background)
4. Financial Projections (revenue targets, burn rate, fundraising details, valuation metrics)
5. Go-to-Market Strategy (customer acquisition cost, timeline metrics, channel performance data)
6. Product Innovation (R&D investment percentages, development timeline, feature metrics)

For EACH section and the overall assessment, include concrete, specific numbers from the deck. If precise numbers aren't available, provide reasonable estimates based on industry standards, but clearly label them as estimates.
