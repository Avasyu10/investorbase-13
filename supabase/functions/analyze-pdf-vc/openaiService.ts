CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. MANDATORY SECTION STRUCTURE: You MUST provide analysis for ALL 10 sections listed above. Each section MUST have exactly the structure shown with all required fields.

2. STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES ARE NEVER OPTIONAL: Every single section MUST have exactly 3-4 strengths and exactly 3-4 weaknesses. There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. Even if a section seems weak or strong, you must find both strengths and weaknesses.

3. ASSESSMENT POINTS: Must contain exactly 7-8 comprehensive detailed bullet points that include:
   - Specific market size data, growth rates, and TAM/SAM numbers from the deck
   - Financial metrics, revenue figures, projections, and unit economics mentioned
   - Traction metrics including user numbers, growth rates, customer acquisition costs
   - Competitive positioning with market share data and differentiation factors
   - Team background with specific credentials, experience, and track record
   - Business model viability with revenue streams and scalability potential
   - Investment opportunity assessment including funding requirements and use of funds
   - Risk factors and mitigation strategies with specific market or execution risks

   Each assessment point should be substantive (2-3 sentences) and include specific numbers, percentages, or quantifiable data wherever possible from the pitch deck.

4. SECTION STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES: Each section must have exactly 3-4 strengths and exactly 3-4 weaknesses.

   STRENGTHS should include:
   - Specific market data, numbers, percentages, or metrics from the deck
   - Industry benchmarks or comparative data when available
   - Quantifiable insights (revenue figures, growth rates, market share, user metrics, etc.)
   - Financial projections, unit economics, or cost structures mentioned
   - Competitive analysis data and positioning metrics

   WEAKNESSES MUST FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON EXTERNAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND DATA:
   - Market saturation data and competitive intensity metrics with specific percentages
   - Economic headwinds or market contraction data affecting the target industry
   - Regulatory challenges or compliance costs with quantified financial impacts
   - Market adoption barriers supported by industry research and data points
   - Customer acquisition challenges based on market dynamics and sector benchmarks
   - Pricing pressure from market conditions with actual cost/revenue impact data
   - Supply chain or operational cost pressures with quantified industry-wide impacts
   - Market timing risks supported by industry trend data and forecasts
   - Sector-specific challenges backed by market research and industry reports

   FORBIDDEN IN WEAKNESSES:
   - Do NOT mention what's missing from the deck or presentation
   - Do NOT suggest what could be improved in the pitch
   - Do NOT mention lack of information or data in the deck
   - Do NOT reference presentation quality or structure
   - Do NOT mention what should be added or clarified
   - Do NOT discuss gaps in the pitch deck content

   REQUIRED FORMAT FOR WEAKNESSES:
   Each weakness must start with market data and include specific numbers. Examples:
   - "Industry reports show 67% of startups in this sector fail within 2 years due to market saturation, with customer acquisition costs rising 45% year-over-year across the industry"
   - "Market research indicates 78% decline in venture funding for EdTech companies in Q3 2024, creating capital constraints with average deal sizes dropping from $4.2M to $1.8M"
   - "Regulatory compliance costs average $3.1M annually for companies in this space, representing 22% of typical revenue according to industry surveys"
   - "Economic data shows 34% contraction in target market spending over past 18 months, with consumer discretionary income in this demographic falling 28%"

5. NEVER SKIP SECTIONS: You must analyze all 10 sections even if some information is not present in the pitch deck. If a section is not well-covered in the deck, still provide the analysis based on industry standards and market context.

Score each section from 1-100 based on investment attractiveness:
- 1-20: Poor - Significant red flags or missing critical information
- 21-40: Below Average - Major concerns that impact investability
- 41-60: Average - Meets basic investment criteria with some concerns
- 61-80: Good - Strong investment potential with minor issues
- 81-100: Excellent - Outstanding investment opportunity

The overall score should reflect the comprehensive investment potential considering market opportunity, execution capability, scalability, and risk-adjusted returns.

MANDATORY: Every weakness MUST be based on external market data, industry statistics, economic conditions, or sector-specific challenges. Do NOT reference the pitch deck's content, structure, or what information it lacks. Focus solely on market realities and industry challenges that could impact the business regardless of how well the deck is prepared.`;
