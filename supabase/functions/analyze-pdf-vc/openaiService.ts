CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. COMPANY INFORMATION EXTRACTION: You MUST extract and include company information from the pitch deck content:
   - Stage: Look for funding stage mentions (seed, pre-seed, series A/B/C, growth, bootstrap, etc.)
   - Industry: Identify the business sector/domain (fintech, healthcare, edtech, saas, marketplace, etc.)
   - Website: Extract any website URLs mentioned in the deck
   - Description: Create a comprehensive description of what the company does, their value proposition, target market, and key differentiators based on the pitch content

2. MANDATORY SECTION STRUCTURE: You MUST provide analysis for ALL 10 sections listed above. Each section MUST have exactly the structure shown with all required fields.

3. DETAILED STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES REQUIREMENT: Every single section MUST have exactly 4 detailed strengths and exactly 4 detailed weaknesses. Each point MUST be:
   - MINIMUM 2 sentences long with detailed explanations
   - Include specific data, numbers, percentages, or quantifiable insights
   - For strengths: Focus on concrete advantages, metrics, and competitive positioning from the pitch deck
   - For weaknesses: Focus EXCLUSIVELY on external market conditions, industry challenges, and sector-specific headwinds with quantified data

4. ASSESSMENT POINTS: Must contain exactly 7-8 comprehensive detailed bullet points that include:
   - Specific market size data, growth rates, and TAM/SAM numbers from the deck
   - Financial metrics, revenue figures, projections, and unit economics mentioned
   - Traction metrics including user numbers, growth rates, customer acquisition costs
   - Competitive positioning with market share data and differentiation factors
   - Team background with specific credentials, experience, and track record
   - Business model viability with revenue streams and scalability potential
   - Investment opportunity assessment including funding requirements and use of funds
   - Risk factors and mitigation strategies with specific market or execution risks

   Each assessment point should be substantive (2-3 sentences) and include specific numbers, percentages, or quantifiable data wherever possible from the pitch deck.

5. DETAILED SECTION STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES REQUIREMENTS:

   STRENGTHS MUST BE DETAILED AND INCLUDE:
   - Minimum 2 sentences per strength with comprehensive explanations
   - Specific market data, numbers, percentages, or metrics from the deck
   - Industry benchmarks or comparative data when available
   - Quantifiable insights (revenue figures, growth rates, market share, user metrics, etc.)
   - Financial projections, unit economics, or cost structures mentioned
   - Competitive analysis data and positioning metrics

   WEAKNESSES MUST FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON EXTERNAL MARKET CONDITIONS WITH DETAILED ANALYSIS:
   - Minimum 2 sentences per weakness with comprehensive market-based explanations
   - Market saturation data and competitive intensity metrics with specific percentages
   - Economic headwinds or market contraction data affecting the target industry
   - Regulatory challenges or compliance costs with quantified financial impacts
   - Market adoption barriers supported by industry research and data points
   - Customer acquisition challenges based on market dynamics and sector benchmarks
   - Pricing pressure from market conditions with actual cost/revenue impact data
   - Supply chain or operational cost pressures with quantified industry-wide impacts
   - Market timing risks supported by industry trend data and forecasts
   - Sector-specific challenges backed by market research and industry reports

   FORBIDDEN IN WEAKNESSES:
   - Do NOT mention what's missing from the deck or presentation
   - Do NOT suggest what could be improved in the pitch
   - Do NOT mention lack of information or data in the deck
   - Do NOT reference presentation quality or structure
   - Do NOT mention what should be added or clarified
   - Do NOT discuss gaps in the pitch deck content

   REQUIRED FORMAT FOR DETAILED WEAKNESSES:
   Each weakness must be minimum 2 sentences and start with market data. Examples:
   - "Industry reports indicate that 67% of startups in this sector experience significant market saturation challenges, with customer acquisition costs rising 45% year-over-year across the industry. This trend is particularly pronounced in the target demographic, where competition for user attention has intensified due to 23 major players entering the market in the past 18 months."
   - "Market research shows a 78% decline in venture funding for EdTech companies in Q3 2024, creating capital constraints with average deal sizes dropping from $4.2M to $1.8M. Economic forecasts suggest this funding winter may persist through 2025, as institutional investors have reduced their education technology allocations by 34% amid concerns about market oversaturation."

6. NEVER SKIP SECTIONS: You must analyze all 10 sections even if some information is not present in the pitch deck. If a section is not well-covered in the deck, still provide the analysis based on industry standards and market context.

Score each section from 1-100 based on these:
1. Problem Clarity & Founder Insight
Key Questions
● Is the problem real, relevant, and urgent?
● Does the team demonstrate first-hand or deep insight into the user pain point?
● Is this a surface-level problem or one rooted in need or behavior?
What to Look For
● Clear articulation of the user’s pain — not generic or fabricated
● Strong signal of understanding: lived experience, research, or user engagement
● Evidence the problem is happening now or increasing in intensity
● Framing that shows insight others might miss
Score Examples
● 1: Vague or fabricated problem with no real evidence
● 3: A real problem but generically stated; insight unclear
● 5: Sharp, grounded articulation with strong founder insight and urgency
2. Founder Capability & Market Fit
Key Questions
● Do the founders have the skills, background, or context to solve this problem better than
others?
● Have they executed before — in startups, domain, or related roles?
● Do their abilities match the demands of this particular market?
What to Look For
● Evidence of execution: built MVPs, shipped product, driven sales, etc.
● Complementary founder mix: technical + GTM, ops + domain, etc.
● Scrappiness, initiative, or relevant lived experience — not just resumes
● Ability to build in a competitive space
Score Examples
● 1: Single founder with little relevant experience or traction
● 3: Founders with some aligned skillsets, but gaps in execution or fit
● 5: Strongly complementary team with relevant context and action orientation
3. Market Opportunity & Entry Strategy
Key Questions
● Is the market large, growing, or undergoing disruption?
● Do they have a believable way to enter and win early?
● Why now — and what tailwinds help them?
What to Look For
● Clear user segment they’re starting with
● Strong “why now” (regulatory, tech, behavior shift, etc.)
● Compelling wedge strategy to break in and expand
● Not just big TAM — focused opportunity with urgency
Score Examples
● 1: Saturated or niche market with no timing logic or entry path
● 3: Reasonable market size and opportunity but entry strategy feels vague
● 5: Large or emerging market with a focused and disruptive entry approach
4. Early Proof or Demand Signals
Key Questions
● Have they validated the idea through user interaction or early testing?
● Is there evidence of real demand (not vanity metrics)?
● Is the product or prototype already in use, even informally?
What to Look For
● MVPs built or tested, even if lightweight
● Feedback loops: user interviews, alpha users, conversions
● Early traction, waitlists, signed pilots, or usage stats
● Signals they’ve done something, not just thought about it
Score Examples
● 1: Idea-stage only, no product or validation efforts
● 3: MVP exists or some user interest shown, but light or unclear
● 5: Clear signs of demand, product feedback, or pull from market
5. Differentiation & Competitive Edge
Key Questions
● How is this startup meaningfully different from competitors?
● Do they have — or could they build — a long-term moat?
● Is their approach uniquely disruptive, not just marginally better?
What to Look For
● Clear USP: different user, workflow, pricing, or experience
● Strong narrative on how they compete and win
● Potential for durable edge (tech, data, network, ecosystem)
● Demonstrates awareness of the competitive landscape
Score Examples
● 1: No clear differentiation or knowledge of existing players
● 3: Some uniqueness, but risk of being a “nice-to-have” or lookalike
● 5: Standout wedge with strong moat-building potential and competitor clarity

The overall score should reflect the comprehensive investment potential considering market opportunity, execution capability, scalability, and risk-adjusted returns.

MANDATORY: Every strength and weakness MUST be detailed (minimum 2 sentences), include specific quantifiable data, and provide comprehensive analysis. This is non-negotiable for generating high-quality investment assessments.`;
