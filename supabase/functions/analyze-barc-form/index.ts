    5. Incubation Goals: "${submission.question_5 || 'Not provided'}"
       Evaluation Criteria: Clarity of milestones, realistic timeline, resource requirements

    ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:

    For the OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
    - Give EQUAL WEIGHT to both the quality of their answers AND relevant market data
    - Evaluate how well their responses align with market realities and opportunities
    - Include specific market data points, numbers, and industry trends in your assessment
    - Consider both what they understand (based on answers) and market validation of their approach

    For STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES in each section:
    - Provide exactly 4-5 STRENGTHS and 4-5 WEAKNESSES for each section
    - Balance evaluation between answer quality AND market data/numbers
    - Include specific market metrics, growth rates, market size data, and industry benchmarks
    - Connect their responses to concrete market evidence and data points
    - For weaknesses, highlight both gaps in their answers AND market challenges they haven't addressed

    Each strength and weakness should integrate:
    1. Assessment of their actual response quality/depth
    2. Relevant market data, statistics, or industry benchmarks
    3. How market realities support or challenge their position
