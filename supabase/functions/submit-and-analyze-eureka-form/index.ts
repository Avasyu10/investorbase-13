    CRITICAL SCORING GUIDELINES - BE EXTREMELY HARSH ON POOR ANSWERS:

    ANSWER LENGTH AND QUALITY REQUIREMENTS (THESE ARE HARD LIMITS):
    - ONE-WORD ANSWERS OR UNDER 5 WORDS: Score 5-15 MAXIMUM (regardless of market potential)
    - UNDER 10 WORDS: Score 5-20 MAXIMUM (regardless of market potential)
    - UNDER 20 WORDS: Score 10-30 MAXIMUM (regardless of market potential)
    - UNDER 50 WORDS: Score 15-45 MAXIMUM (rarely above 40)
    - 50-100 WORDS: Can score up to 60-70 if high quality
    - 100+ WORDS with specifics: Can score 70-85
    - 150+ WORDS with comprehensive analysis: Can score 80-95
    - 200+ WORDS with exceptional depth: Can score 90-100

    ANSWER QUALITY IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR - Market data should only be used as context, NOT to inflate scores for poor answers.

    90-100: Exceptional responses with deep insights, clear evidence, comprehensive understanding, DETAILED RESPONSES (150+ words with specific examples, data, and thorough explanations)
    80-89: Strong responses with good evidence and understanding, minor gaps, GOOD DETAIL (100-150 words with some specifics)
    70-79: Adequate responses with some evidence, moderate understanding, MODERATE DETAIL (50-100 words)
    60-69: Weak responses with limited evidence, significant gaps, BRIEF RESPONSES (20-50 words)
    40-59: Poor responses with minimal substance, major deficiencies, VERY SHORT (10-20 words)
    20-39: Very poor responses, largely inadequate or missing key elements, EXTREMELY SHORT (5-10 words)
    1-19: Extremely poor or non-responses, ONE-WORD ANSWERS OR MEANINGLESS TEXT (under 5 words)

    MARKET INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT:
    For each section, integrate relevant market data including: market size figures, growth rates, customer acquisition costs, competitive landscape data, industry benchmarks, success rates, and financial metrics. Balance response quality assessment with market context. However, POOR ANSWER QUALITY CANNOT BE COMPENSATED BY GOOD MARKET DATA.

    For ASSESSMENT POINTS (8-10 points required):
    Each point MUST be detailed (3-4 sentences each) and contain specific numbers: market sizes ($X billion), growth rates (X% CAGR), customer metrics ($X CAC), competitive data, success rates (X%), and industry benchmarks, seamlessly integrated with response evaluation. Each assessment point should provide substantial market intelligence that connects startup positioning with industry realities, competitive dynamics, and growth opportunities.

    CRITICAL CHANGE - For WEAKNESSES (exactly 4-5 each per section):
    WEAKNESSES must focus ONLY on market data challenges and industry-specific risks that the company faces, NOT on response quality or form completeness. Examples:
    - Market saturation concerns (X% of market already captured by incumbents)
    - High customer acquisition costs in this sector ($X CAC vs industry average)
    - Regulatory challenges affecting X% of similar companies
    - Economic headwinds impacting sector growth (X% decline in funding)
    - Technology adoption barriers affecting X% of target market
    - Competitive pressure from well-funded players with $X backing
    - Market timing risks based on industry cycles

    For STRENGTHS (exactly 4-5 each per section):
    - STRENGTHS: Highlight what they did well, supported by market validation and data

    CRITICAL ADDITION - SCORING REASON REQUIREMENT:
    Generate a brief 1-2 sentence explanation for the overall score that summarizes the key factors that led to this rating. This should be concise but specific about what drove the score up or down.

    Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ANSWER QUALITY IS THE PRIMARY SCORING FACTOR - poor answers cannot be saved by market potential
2. CREATE SIGNIFICANT SCORE DIFFERENCES - excellent detailed responses (80-100), poor short responses (5-30)
3. Use the exact metrics provided for each question in your evaluation
4. HEAVILY PENALIZE SHORT, SUPERFICIAL ANSWERS - follow the strict word count limits above
5. REWARD DETAILED, THOUGHTFUL RESPONSES - comprehensive answers with specifics should score 80-100
6. ASSESSMENT POINTS: Each of the 8-10 points must be heavily weighted toward market data, numbers, and quantifiable metrics with 3-4 sentences each
7. Focus weaknesses ONLY on market data challenges and industry risks - NOT response quality or form gaps
8. Provide exactly 4-5 strengths and 4-5 weaknesses per section
9. All scores must be 1-100 scale
10. Return only valid JSON without markdown formatting
11. MOST IMPORTANT: Poor answer quality (short, vague, one-word answers) CANNOT be compensated by good market analysis
12. MUST include scoring_reason field with brief 1-2 sentence justification for overall score
13. WEAKNESSES MUST FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON EXTERNAL MARKET CONDITIONS WITH DETAILED ANALYSIS
14. EACH SECTION'S 'analysis' FIELD MUST START WITH A CLEAR, CONCISE (1-2 SENTENCE) REASON FOR THE ASSIGNED SCORE, BEFORE ANY FURTHER DETAILED ANALYSIS. Also in the 'analysis' part that what could have been added more in the answer and how it missed something. It should be about that section based on answers and include market data.
15. **Very Important**: Never give any market number or data as "X" or "Y", it should always be an actual number. If not available skip it just don't use these.
